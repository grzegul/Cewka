# Application takes as an input parameters of the air coil (number of turns, wire diameter) and capacitor(s) (capacitance, amount
# and way of connecting them) and outputs the induction level reached at the inside of the coil.
# Required software:
# Linux (bash), Octave, FEMM(via wine).
#
# TODO: Make it more compact and flexible. First steps are made, but there still is a great amount of refactoring.
